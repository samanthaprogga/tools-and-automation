Conflitcs


merge conflict in Git occurs when there are conflicting changes between
different branches that Git cannot automatically resolve. This conflict arises
when the changes made to the same part of a file in different branches cannot
be seamlessly merged together. When attempting to merge these branches, Git
halts the process and prompts the user to manually resolve the conflicting
changes by editing the affected files. During this resolution process, the user
must decide which changes to keep, discard, or modify, and then mark the
conflict as resolved. Once all conflicts are resolved, the user can continue
the merge process by committing the changes, finalizing the merge, and updating
the repository with the resolved code. Resolving merge conflicts effectively is
crucial to maintaining a clean and functional codebase when collaborating on
projects with multiple contributors
Fixing a conflict locally
