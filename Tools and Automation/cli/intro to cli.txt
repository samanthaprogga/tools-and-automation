Intro to CLI and basic commands

CLI stands for Command Line Interface. It is a program that
allows users to type text commands instructing the computer to
 do specific tasks

The command Line is something every developer should learn and 
implement into their daily routine

Windows: Window Shell / WIndows Terminal /Git Bash
UNIX (MacOS and Linus) : Terminal

Let's install Git to have access to git bash


Listing files and directions

>ls       | list all files and directories in the current directory
>ls -a    | list all files and directories+ hidden files
>ls -l    | list files and directories + info about them(type, permission, etc)
>ls -la   | we can combine options
>ls -R    | list all files and directories + files in the subdirectors

Permissions: what do these letters mean?
  d: directory
  rwx: read, write and execute -> user
  r-x: read and execute        -> group
  --x: execute                 -> other


  Changing directories

  >pwd      | print the current working directory(the dir you are in)

  >cd ..    | Return to the previous directory (move one level up)
  >cd/      | move to the root directory
  >cd or cd~| move to the home directory
