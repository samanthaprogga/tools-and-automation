Creating directories and files

## MAKE A DIRECTORY ##

mkdir <desired name>
for example: mkdir test   // The command mkdir test make a new directory named "test" in the current working directory.

// we can also make two or more directory together 
> mkdir one two three  // making all three directory together


## REMOVE A DIRECTORY ##
 1. > rmdir <name of directory> or rm -d | remove an empty directory
 2. > rm-r <dir> | remove a non-empty directory (remove all files recursively)


## CREATING FILES ##
> touch <file.ext> | create a new (empty) file
> echo 'content' > file name  | redirect the output to a file (overwrite the file)  // between content and file name (>) this is necesarry
> echo 'content' >> <file> | append content to the end of the file  // (>>) appending refers to adding new content to the end of an existing file. 


## MOVE AND RENAME THE FILES AND DIRECTORIES ##
> mv  <current_name> <new_name> | rename a file
